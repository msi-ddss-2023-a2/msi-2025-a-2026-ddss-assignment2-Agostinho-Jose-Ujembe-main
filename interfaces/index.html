        <p>
            <strong>The goal of this exercise</strong> is to implement three simple
            functionalities of a Web application, including two versions for each
            functionality: one correctly implemented from a security perspective
            (i.e. applying good security practices), and the other having software
            vulnerabilities (SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, etc.).
        </p>

        <p>The functionalities implemented are as follows:</p>

        <nav>
            <a href="part1.html">Part 1.1</a><br>
            <a href="part2.html">Part 1.2</a><br>
            <a href="part3.html">Part 1.3</a>
        </nav>
